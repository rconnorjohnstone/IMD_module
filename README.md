# IMD_module
Collection of python functions for use in Interplanetary Mission Design

This module is relatively simple for now, but it does provide some very useful tools,  including 3-Body Problem solutions, orbit propogation, and most thoroughly, Lambert's algorithm solvers for a variety of interplanetary (and earth-based) mission design tools.

# Availability
This tool is not currently available in any official capacity. The documentation is incomplete and the code could use some organization. However, feel free to clone from source and use the module by way of implicitly importing the files and using:

    using .imd

#Further Work
 - Provide complete documentation
 - Provide example julia scripts
 - Improve performance
 - Publish officially
